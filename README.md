Some feature of my programm:

- autoclose iris on incoming wormhole
- autoopen iris if correct IDC is received
- autoclose stargate after X seconds
- show all kinds of stats
- multiple languages right now german and english (because I don't speak anything else)
- can display energy in EU or RF
- displays up to 10 addresses on 1 page (unlimited pages)
- allows dialing from an address list
- checking for updates on start
- emit redstone signals (right now for: state not idle, incoming, iris closed, idc accepted, wormhole connected)
- automatically adds new, unkown addresses when there is an incoming wormhole
- shows the required energy to dial an address (or error if invalid address)
